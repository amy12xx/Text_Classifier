Philosophy^Understanding the Obamas Understanding the Obamas Barack Hussein Obama's ascension to the U.S. presidency struck many people as evidence that an old era had ended and a new one was dawning. Many accounts of this historic shift quickly emerged, with Mr. Obama heralded as the prophet of everything from post-partisan politics to a post-imperial and, most famously, post-racial America. These conceptions of the Obama presidency as somehow bringing a phase of history to a close raise the questions that organize this course. Does the election of a black president mean that the US has become post-racial? Does the peculiar resistance to Michelle Obama undermine the claims of post-racialism? Does the election of this black president - a man who is in some ways as white or Asian as black, and who has no civil rights 'struggle credentials' - mean that the US politics and culture have entered a post-black or post-civil rights moment? Have the multiple global crises on Mr. Obama's plate made him our first post-imperial president?

Philosophy^Ancient Democratic Theory Ancient Democratic Theory As the classical Greeks experimented in democracy and self-government, they experimented too in the best ways to think and talk about their political ideals, realities, and tragedies. We are fortunate to have their speeches, treaties, and plays most characterized by rhetorical vigor, philosophical frankness, and comic irony. Our work will be to read broadly in the Athenian literature about the earliest world-historical democracy, notably Thuydides, Aristophanes, Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle, and to focus on their reflections on gender, class, slavery, education, deliberation, persuasion, freedom of speech, and self-improvement. We aim to discover  what the anicents deemed "democracy,"  what they treated as most puzzling about democracy in theory or practice,  what modes of discussion and argument proved most productive or delibilitating, and  what about human nature and social life justifies-if it does-any form of democracy, in the ancient period.

Anthropology^From Recipients to Donors: Unpacking the Global Development Apparatus From Recipients to Donors: Unpacking the Global Development Apparatus How often have you seen a call to end poverty coupled with images of brown people presumably located on the other side of the globe? Much of the public discourxe about international development focuses on recipients of aid in the so-called "Global South" and their problems and needs. This course shifts your gaze in other directions. We begin by looking from recipients to donors - at the global development apparatus and the development professionals that staff development agencies; we then consider how the tidy formulations of 'donor' and 'recipient' have been upset by the recent phenomenon of the so- called 'emerging donors'. We examine two such donor countries: Russia and China. You will go out and retreive current examples of discourse about donors and recipients of international development assistance and will critically unpack it. The goal of the class is to foster a different way of seeing the workd and the relationships within it.
Anthropology^Inequality in America Inequality in America This course explores the sociocultural dimensions and lived experiences of inequality in the contemporary United States. Our discussions draw on works in anthropoloty, sociology, economics, history, cultural studies, and investigative journalism to examine how economic policies, exacerbated by the Great Recession, impact Americans divided by identity categories such as race, class, gender, and citizenship. We focus on ways in which the social dynamics that produce inequality are embedded in worlds of cultural meaning and institutionalized as taken-for-granted aspects of everyday life. Structural disparities in income, wealth, and opportunity ultimately raise questions about the kind of society we live in an whether the nation's democratic ideals can survive the extreme polarization of life changes that exist in America today.
