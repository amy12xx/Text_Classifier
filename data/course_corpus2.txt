This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered.

In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them, we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure, uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change, as they are becoming more and more web-based, transnational and privatized, while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict. In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design, management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed: What are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development? What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future? How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved? Will they become accessible for all global citizens, always and everywhere? Will they remain affordable for future generations? Will they exhaust the natural environment? Will established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations? How about security and privacy? In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain, for example, how public values are expressed in infrastructure design, and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design, management and governance of infrastructure. If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's (next generation) infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional.

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioural economics and allows the student to develop a hands-on approach by learning its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice. In three modules, students will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behaviour change, b) learn how to critique, design and interpret experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.  Students will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “Is nudging manipulative?” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioural economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you. Guest Appearances:  Several leading scholars, policy makers, businesspeople and commentators will make short appearances in our debate and discussion sections.

Finance^Intro to Credit Risk Management^An Introduction to Credit Risk Management^You are a bank and a big part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately for you, lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or, in a less extreme situation, the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system, so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks, together with market risk and operational risk, a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course, the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For every methodology, we will analyze its points of strengths, but we will also stress its points of weakness.

We stuff our bodies with food, often unaware of the fact that food profoundly influences our emotional and physical well-being in the short term and in the long term. Scientific studies indicate that what we eat has a profound impact on our current and future health. Many people want to eat a healthier diet but are torn between the numerous conflicting and very confusing messages thrown at us by healthcare professionals, self-professed nutrition consultants, journalists, and even academic scientists. Every day you hear about a new fad diet with an “unprecedented” success rate that promises a long and healthy life or simply causes your fat to melt away.

At the same time we may be warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame or MSG. Dietary supplements may be touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on. This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micro nutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the best science available.

How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes?

Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on.
